To run this program you will need to have a java version of at least 16,
you also need to have gradle installed on your pc. If these requirements
are met then you will need to change you terminal directory to the one 
where the project is located using the cd command eg:
```shell script
cd desktop/Project_2-1
```
When you have changed directory into the project where build.gradle is located
you will have to run the following command:
```shell script
gradle run
```
This should launch the program and enable you to play the game.
